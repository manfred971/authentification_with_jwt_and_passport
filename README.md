# authentification_with_jwt_and_passport
Here a brief overview of the application you will be building:      The user signs up, and a user account is created.     The user logs in, and a JSON web token is assigned to the user.     This token is sent by the user when trying to access certain secure routes.     Once the token has been verified, the user is then allowed to access the route.
